WHAT RESNET MODEL DOES 
When applied to the MNIST dataset (which consists of handwritten digits 0-9), ResNet classifies images into one of these 10 categories.
⚡ How It Works:

✅ Uses Residual Blocks – Helps prevent information loss in deep networks by using skip connections.
✅ Extracts Features – Learns key patterns in digit images like curves and edges.
✅ Makes Predictions – After feature extraction, a fully connected layer predicts the digit (0-9).
